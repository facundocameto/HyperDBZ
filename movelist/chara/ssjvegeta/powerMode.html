					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating SSJ Blue Mode has Vegeta turning over a new leaf!
					This changes a few things, gameplay-wise.<br>
					- At activation, you will see two bars: The top one is an automatically refilling Blue Step Cancel bar.<br>
					- The bottom bar one is your conventional Finisher Level bar. This bar is, in SSJ Vegeta's case, filled by forward momentum. 
					The faster you're traveling forward, the faster it fills up. When you retreat, it drains again. 
					If you get knocked down, it also drains a solid chunk. In short, acting like an aggressor rewards you.<br>
					- Gain access to the Blue Step Cancel. It allows you to cancel almost anything (including Special Moves) into the Saiyan Step. 
					Every time you use a Blue Step Cancel, the bar is instantly drained and you won't be able to use it again until it's refilled, 
					which happens automatically and takes about 1-2 seconds. As you use the Blue Step Cancel multiple times within a combo, it fills back up slower each time.<br>
					- Gain access to a short hop (tap UB/U/UF).<br>
					- Gain access to SSJ Blue Evolved Mode (detailed below).<br>
					- Taunting fills your Finisher Bar. By quite a lot actually.<br>
					- Elite Assault costs LV2 instead of LV3 but takes you out of the mode if you fail to connect with it.<br>
					- Gain Finishers for Elite Assault depending on the level of the SSJ Blue Bar. The Finishers are:<br>
					LV1 - Spirit Breaking Cannon.<br>
					LV2 - Big Bang Attack.<br>
					LV3 - Falling Empire.</div>

					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating SSJ Blue Evolved Mode has Vegeta turning over a new leaf! Again!
					This changes a few things, gameplay-wise.<br>
					- First off, you'll have to be at least on Level 1 of SSJ Blue Mode before you can go into this Evolved one.<br>
					- At activation, your Pride bar is converted into the SSJ Blue Evolved Bar. It automatically drains from whatever point it was filled before activation into Evolved.
					So the farther the bar was filled, the longer the SSJ Blue Evolved Mode will last. When the bar is drained, the Mode ends and Vegeta is dizzied.<br>
					- While in this mode, your Power Bar automatically fills up.<br>
					- Retain the Blue Step Cancel, though you'll notice that the bar for it is now gone. So no more buffer/overheat limitation.<br>
					- Gain 'ghost impact'; all of Vegeta's basic attacks now cause an additional impact/explosion upon hitting the enemy.<br>
					- Elite Assault retains the reduced cost of LV2 instead of LV3.<br>
					- If the opponent is not KO'd before the Blue Evolved Mode ends, Vegeta will be left powerless and dizzied.</div>
