					<!-- Move Description -->
					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating Demon Mode gives Piccolo a dark edge, tapping into his latent demonic power.
					This changes a few things, gameplay-wise. <br>
					-Upon activation, you will see an empty Demon Bar and a grey kanji added to the screen.
					The Demon Bar can fill up three times and the kanji changes colors each time. Grey = LV0, Yellow = LV1,
					Orange = LV2 and Red/Pink Flashing = LV3/Max.<br>
					-Using any 'demon' moves fills the Demon Bar. These include
					the Standing Strong Punch, Double Claw, forward throw, Eye Laser, Destructive Wave, Mystic Harpoon (both versions),
					Trap Blast and Trap Blast Break.<br>
					-EX Mystic Harpoon's ender changes from a Mouth Blast to a souped-up Eye Laser. In comparisson,
					the Eye Laser ender does 20 more damage, has a faster recovery time and keeps the opponent airborne a tad longer.<br>
					-Trap Blast becomes available (detailed below).<br>
					-Gains the Dead End (detailed below).<br>
					-Hellzone Grenade costs LV2 instead of LV3 and takes you out of the mode.<br>
					-Depending on how far your Demon Bar is filled when you activate the Hellzone Grenade,
					Piccolo will perform a unique Finisher at the end of it:<br>
					LV1 - Light Grenade.<br>
					LV2 - Mafuba Seal.<br>
					LV3 - Giant Demon.</div>

					<!-- Move Description -->
					<div class="col-lg-12">Upon activation, Piccolo goes into a charging state.
					if the opponent hits him with a physical attack during this state, Piccolo bursts into a radial explosion,
					knocking anyone he hits up into the air. Piccolo will also automatically perform the explosion
					after a certain amount of time. If you don't hold the punch button,
					he'll perform the explosion right away, though it'll be less damaging then.
					If he's hit by a projectile attack however, he's knocked out of the move,
					but you can use the explosion to destroy incoming projectile attacks.
					Works great as an anti-air. If he's hit by an opponent attacking from the air,
					the explosion will do an additional hit.
					Being a Power Mode Exit, it will have a stronger version depending on what level of Demon Mode you're currently at when you activate it.</div>

					<div class="col-lg-12">A child version of his Hellzone Grenade,
					Piccolo can place energy balls all across the sky to hinder the opponent.
					QCF+K balls are shot at a diagonal angle, while the QCB+K balls
					are created above Piccolo, and then travel on a horizontal (and squiggly) trajectory to their destination.
					Weak Kick places balls close to Piccolo, while SK balls are placed far across the screen.
					The balls are inactive when they float to their position,
					but become solid objects as soon as they're placed.
					If the opponent touches one, it explodes. If you've created a bunch of Trap Blasts, the opponent might
					be juggled from Trap Blast to Trap Blast. Yeah, take it!
					The balls can also be detonated: d,d+P for the QCF+K versions, and d,d+K for the QCB+K versions.
					Keep in mind that you need to use the same button to detonate each version: d,d+LP for a QCF+LK Trap Blast,
					d,d+MP for a QCF+MK Trap Blast, etc.
					There's a 6 ball on-screen simultaneously limit to the Trap Blasts, regardless of on which level you're at. </div>
