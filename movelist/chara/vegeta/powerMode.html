					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating Rage Mode has Vegeta going into a fit of fury!
					This changes a few things, gameplay-wise.<br>
					- At activation, you will see a full Buffer Bar (blue), an empty Rage Bar (orange) and a grey kanji (which stands for 'rage).<br>
					- Loses Dash Elbow and Zetto Counter moves. <br>
					- Gains access to EX (ground and aerial) Machine Gun Temper. <br>
					- Gains access a fourth level of charge for his Ki Blast. His EX Ki Blast also becomes this 4th level. <br>
					- Performing Ki Blast and Machine Gun Temper moves (both normal and EX) fill your Rage bar. <br>
					- EX Ki Blast and EX Machine Gun Temper can be performed with no power, but they drain the Buffer Bar. The mode ends if the Buffer Bar is completely drained.<br>
					- Galactic Gunfire is not chargeable anymore but becomes unblockable. <br>
					- Galactic Gunfire costs Lv2 instead of Lv3 but can be performed only when the kanji is Lv1 or more and takes you out of the mode upon activation. <br>
					- Gains finishers for Galactic Gunfire, depending on the level of the Rage Bar. </div>
