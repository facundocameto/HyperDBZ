					<!-- Move Description -->
					<div class="col-lg-12"> Activating the Confidence Mode changes a few things in Krillin's gameplay.<br>
					- Upon activation an empty Confidence Bar (bottom bar), a full buffer bar (on top of that) and a Krillin head are added to the screen. <br>
					- His forward walk becomes faster, while his backwards walk becomes slower.<br>
					- Ground Forward Dash becomes a more standard traveling dash instead of that tiny spurt.<br>
					- Ground Backdash is turned into a fast smear, covering a greater distance in a shorter amount of time.<br>
					- Air Forward Dash can be cancelled before the dash animation ends.<br>
					- Faster recovery after a Jet Kamehameha (only the first one in each combo).<br>
					- Gain access to Wild Sense along with Mirage (detailed below).<br>
					- Gain access to an additional Rocketman in the same jump (now able to do any combination of two regular ones and two EX ones). <br>
					- Able to throw a second and third Destructo Disc by pressing any Punch button two times after throwing the first.<br>
					- Gain access to the Senzu Bean (detailed below). <br>
					- Solar Flare x100 costs Lv2 instead of Lv3 and cancels the Confidence bar.<br>
					- Performing Fake Special Moves and the Duck 'n Cover fills your Confidence bar.<br>
					- Performing the both additional Rocketman and Wild Sense takes a small portion of the buffer bar. The Mirage takes an even larger chunk. When the bar is emptied, the Mode is cancelled out.<br>
					- Depending if you're on Lv1, 2 or 3 of the Confidence Bar, Krillin will perform a unique and powerful Finisher at the end of the Solar Flare x100.

					<!-- Move Description -->
					<div class="col-lg-12">The Wild Sense is a 'stance' that grants you access to a variety of moves going out of it.
					Using it takes away a tiny portion of the Confidence bar, so keep that in mind.
					When the bar is completely emptied, it cancels out the Confidence Mode.
					But mind that each variant of the Wild Sense can only have a single move come out of it, at least the ones done with the Kick button.
					QCB+LK, then any Kick makes Krillin do a back handspring, his legs kicking anyone close enough to him (you're gonna want to hit an opponent that's advancing towards you with it).
					QCB+MK, then any Kick makes Krillin leap up and forward, then shooting a Ki Blast down-forward.
					QCB+SK, then any Kick sees Krillin performing a Rocketman, propelling himself vertically off the ground.<br><br>
					Those are the different moves performed with a Kick button. However there is one more move hidden behind the Wild Sense - the Mirage.
					Pressing any Punch button after any QCB+K makes you go 'wow' as Krilllin seemingly splits into a row of 3 instances of himself!
					However there is really only one instance that's able to deal and receive damage. Which one that is, is up to you.
					Activating Mirage with LP and the Krillin in the back is the real on. With MK, the one in the middle. With SK, the one in the front.
					Each time you activate a Mirage, it takes away an additional portion of your Confidence bar. Remember that it cancels out your Confidence Mode when it's completely emptied.
					Lastly, the Wild Sense also acts as a counter. When Krillin is hit by a physical attack during the scaredy pose, he'll
					automatically (and successfully) perform the move that would have come out by pressing the Kick button.
