					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating Unleashed Mode has Gohan unlocking his full potential. This changes a few things, gameplay-wise.<br>
					- At activation, you will see an empty Unleashed Bar (which is devided into 3 sections representing Lv1, Lv2 and Lv3)
					and a red kanji added to the screen.<br>
					- Gohan's Power Charge now charges both his Power Bar and (slowly) his Unleashed Bar. <br>
					- Hitting the opponent with Omni Kicks and both Hurricane Kicks attacks gradually fills the Unleashed Bar. <br>
					- His Masenko becomes the chargeble projectile version.<br>
					- He gains diagonal directions to his airdashing. <br>
					- Gekiretsu Ranbu costs Lv2 instead of Lv3 and takes you out of the mode upon activation. 
					  It also gets a unique Finisher depending on the Unleashed Bar level.</div>

					<div class="col-lg-12">Gohan's exit from Unleashed Mode sees him performing the famous Kamehameha. The intensity is determined at how far your Unleashed Bar is filled:<br>
					-At LV0, Gohan fires a Kamehameha projectile comparable to Goku's LV1 version.<br>
					-At LV1, Gohan fires a Kamehameha beam comparable to Goku's uncharged LV2 version.<br>
					-At LV3, Gohan is assisted by Goten and the both of them fire a meaty beam.<br>
					-At LV3, Gohan is assisted by both Goten and Goku and the three of them fire a massive, sky-shattering combined beam.<br>
					All versions have two variants: Long-range (a blast/beam being fired truly, in-game) and a close-range version 
					(Gohan first kicks the opponent against the wall, then teleports back and prepares his attack, this is a more cinematic variant, especially in the case of the LV3).
